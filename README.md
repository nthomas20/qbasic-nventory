# qbasic-nventory
(i)nventory manager written in qbasic!

This is a personal software project from 1993. This was intented just to keep track of an inventory of "things". While the version and release numbers might seem "high" for such a project, I was basically just making them up at that time to be "cool"

I remember compiling this to an executable using QB45. Designed to run from the DOS prompt it was just "NVENTORY.EXE"
